# What is it, how does it work and how do I get to one:
Linux has a graphical user interface and it works pretty much like the GUI's on other systems that you are familiar with such as Windows and OSX.
This tutorial will focus instead on the command line (also known as a terminal) running Bash.
If you're on a Mac then you'll find the program Terminal under Applications -> Utilities. An easy way to get to it is the key combination 'command + space' which will bring up Spotlight, then start typing Terminal and it will soon show up.
If on Linux then you will probably find it in Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities. Alternatively you may be able to 'right-click' on the desktop and there may be an option 'Open in terminal'.
If you are on Windows and intend to remotely log into another machine then you will need an SSH client. A rather good one is Putty (free) .

# An introduction to the Linux directory system and how to get around it:
An introduction to the Linux directory system and how to get around it.

 being proficient with Linux. Whenever we refer to either a file or directory on the command line, we are in fact referring to a path. ie. A path is a means to get to a particular file or directory on the system.

It is denoted by a single slash ( / ). It has subdirectories, they have subdirectories and so on. Files may reside in any of these directories.

Absolute paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( / )


## Find out some interesting characteristics of files and directories in a Linux environment:

The manual pages are a set of pages that explain every command available on your system including what they do, the specifics of how you run them and what command line arguments they accept. 
More on the Running of Commands,
A lot of being proficient at Linux is knowing which command line options we should use to modify the behaviour of our commands to suit our needs. A lot of these have both a long hand and short hand version.
