# Linked List

## what is a linked list?

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.

## analogy :
A linked list is like a train. Each car is a node. The node contains the data and a pointer to the next node. The last car has a pointer to null.

## why linked list?

Circular Linked List

## singly linked list
A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.

Each data structure contains two items: the data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next data structure in the sequence. The last data structure has a link to a null value.
