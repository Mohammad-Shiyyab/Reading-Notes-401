## What are the key differences between classes and objects in Python, and how are they used to create and manage instances of a class?
Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.

## Explain the concept of recursion and provide an example of how it can be used to solve a problem in Python. What are some best practices to follow when implementing a recursive function?
A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions. This means that the function will continue to call itself until some condition is met to return a result.

example:

def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
Each recursive call has its own execution context, so to maintain state during recursion you have to either:

Thread the state through each recursive call so that the current state is part of the current callâ€™s execution context
Keep the state in global scope
some best practices:

function have a base case
function change his state and move toward the base case when calling itself
if we unnecessarily recomputing values. try to improve the function by caching the results
Keep stack overflow limitation in mind if you have a program that requires deep recursion.
What is the purpose of pytest fixtures and code coverage in testing Python code? Explain how they can be used together to improve the quality and maintainability of a project
fixtures are functions, which will run some code before each test ,You'll want to have some objects available to all of your tests. Those objects might contain data you want to share across tests, or they might involve the network or filesystem.

In pytest, you define fixtures using a combination of the pytest.fixture decorator, along with a function definition.

@pytest.fixture
def some_data():
    return 42
