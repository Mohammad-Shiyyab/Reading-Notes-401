Deliberate practice is an activity designed by a teacher to improve specific aspects of an individual's performance. It pushes an individual outside their comfort zone, provides feedback on results, is highly demanding mentally, is difficult, and requires good goals. Cal Newport's quote from his blog highlights the importance of deliberate practice, which can be summarized as activities designed by a teacher for the sole purpose of effectively improving specific aspects of an individual's performance. Challenges can be set to meet these criteria, and the only person who understands the skillset well enough to teach is the individual. Challenges should push you outside your comfort zone and be surmountable.

They should be repeated often and get feedback on subjective measures of code. Goals should be chosen such that they are mentally exhausting. Practice should not feel like easy, frustration-free technical problems.

# How to think like a programmer:

Richard Reis explains how to become a better problem-solver by following the advice in Tim Ferriss' book "The 4-Hour Chef" and interviewing two impressive people. He explains that problem-solving skills are the most important qualification employers look for, more than programming languages proficiency, debugging, and system design. To find the right framework, he followed the advice in Tim Ferriss' book "The 4-Hour Chef" and interviewed two impressive people. Jordan Ball and V. Anton Spraul discussed the importance of understanding a problem and planning a solution when faced with a new one. Understanding a problem is when you can explain it in plain English.

Planing a solution means writing down the exact steps and giving your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information. This will help you get a lot further a lot quicker.



# Solving Problems:
John Sonmez outlines a set of steps to help programmers solve programming problems. The most important step is to read the problem completely twice, solve it manually with 3 sets of sample data, optimize the manual steps, write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code, replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code, and optimize the real code. As much as 70% of time should be spent in steps 1-3. The most important details in this text are that it is important to read the problem 3-4 times and understand it completely. It is also important to solve the problem manually with at least three different inputs to make sure you understand the solution and that it will work for more than one case. It is also important to recognize corner cases and edge cases when solving a problem manually.
