Q1)
DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHEM:chosing the right data structure is very important no data structure is perfect all of them are good and bad at differnt things 
,each data structure are good at cuntain things and bad at other things so firstly we have to know 
the nature of the problem


**TYPE OR EXAMPLE OF DATA STRUCTURE :

1) linked list :
    the list of it called "Node" which contain a value and container .
    valu :is simple described as a number.
    container :simple connected us to the next node.
*the first node called a head and the last called a tail.

2) Array:
    it is very super common in all programming language.
    it is quite literally a continous black of cells in  
    the computer .

3) Hash Table:
   it is object in the javaScript and python.

4) Stack + Queu:
   they are pretty similar and they are both kind of built on top of arrays 
   with a few additional features they are efficient add and remove but have 
   limited use cases.
 
5)Graphs + Trees :
  Kind similar to linked list where you have nodes that are pointing to other 
  nodes except in this case the pointers are called edges [they could have weight 
  or number ]


Q2)  Set a base case .
